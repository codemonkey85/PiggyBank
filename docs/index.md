# Welcome to the PiggyBank project.

PiggyBank is a project to create a household financial appliance.

Traditional accounting software is either single-user (not good for families and groups) or "in the cloud"
(i.e. your data on someone else's computer).

PiggyBank is an appliance that resolves this conflict by hosting accounting software you use through your web
browser on a device in your house. Your data stays safe at home. You decide who can use the appliance, and how,
and the appliance itself is a cute little piggybank with a small computer screen in it so that you can get a
quick visual on how you are doing!
